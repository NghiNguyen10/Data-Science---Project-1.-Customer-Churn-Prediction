# Data-Science---Project-1.-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project considers a prediction problem arising at a mobile phone operator AT (see [2]) with regard to customer churn, customer who leave a company for others. Predictive models are built to help the company AT predict the customer churn. The solution includes the developing a full predictive data analytics solution to this business problem. Based on the nature of the data, two methodologies, Multi-variate Logistic Regression and Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithms, are employed to build models to solve the problem using Python. The two models are compared with respect to their performance such as the accuracy before improvement and after improvement to help the manager of AT to reduce the customer churn. Six steps of CRISP-DM are implemented to achieve the solution. The six steps are Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. Initial findings show promising results as the models achieved reasonable accuracies to predict the churn.
